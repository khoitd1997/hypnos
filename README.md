# hypnos

Module embedded inside users' laptop to "remind" them to take break and sleep

## Background

I used to have a script that runs every couple hours to turn the computer off to remind me to take a break. However, that script can be easily bypassed and it's not cross-platform. Embedding ```hypnos``` into the motherboard of my laptop and enabling tamperproof protection in the BIOS for the case make it much harder to bypass.

## Features

- Interact with device through phone app
    - Allow users' actions to be asynchronous, save and transmit their actions when the device is connected
    - Allow a limited number of exceptions through tokens per month: Allow users to select a time range that they don't want to be disturbed, the number of tokens needed are automatically calculated and applied
        - Waving sleep time as well as applying many tokens in the same day should cost more to prevent binge
    - Customizable work and break duration(there has to be an upper and lower limit though)
    - Limit amount of total screen time per day
    - Statistics for tracking progress
    - Foreground task to show device status as well as current phase
    - Synchronize with app to keep correct time, remind users to connect to device if they haven't for a long time
    - Indicate the current time stretch
    - Bed time and wake time
    - Battery indicator
- Flexibly adapt to user' start of day
- Hard to abuse or bypass but also possible to remove when truly necessary
- Low power consumption
- User has pending actions like changing rest interval
- Need corrective actions such as clock syncing
- Reset switch for resetting all settings(including BLE bonding information)
- Small size: About 1.5 x 1.5 inch

## Custom GATT

The custom service is called the ```Tracking Service```. ```Base and other UUIDs``` are taken [here](https://github.com/NordicPlayground/nRF5x-custom-ble-service-tutorial):

```c
// base is f364adc9-b000-4042-ba50-05ca45bf8abc
#define UUID_BASE         {0xBC, 0x8A, 0xBF, 0x45, 0xCA, 0x05, 0x50, 0xBA, \
                                          0x40, 0x42, 0xB0, 0x00, 0xC9, 0xAD, 0x64, 0xF3}
#define UUID_SERVICE 0x1400
```

To store an hour:minute info, needs 11 bits(5 for hour, 6 for minute). All timing is stored that way except for the current time service

All would require authentication to read/write

| UUID   | Type                  | Data Type         | Range                           |
|--------|-----------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------|
| 0x1401 | DAY_START             | time type         | 24-hour format                  |
| 0x1402 | DAY_END               | time type         | 24-hour format                  |
| 0x1403 | WORK_DURATION_MINUTE  | uint8             | 0-120                           |
| 0x1404 | BREAK_DURATION_MINUTE | uint8             | 0-120                           |
| 0x1405 | TODAY_EXCEPTIONS      | list of time type | 0-5 items                       |
| 0x1406 | TOKENS_LEFT           | uint8             | depend on policy implementation |
